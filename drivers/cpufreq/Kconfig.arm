	  Support for the CPUFreq HW driver.
	  Some MediaTek chipsets have a HW engine to offload the steps
	  necessary for changing the frequency of the CPUs. Firmware loaded
	  in this engine exposes a programming interface to the OS.
	  The driver implements the cpufreq interface for this HW engine.
	  Say Y if you want to support CPUFreq HW.
